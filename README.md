# hyperViz
Code for the SEMF hyperViz project (link coming soon)  
The initial goal is to parse data collected as a csv via registration forms and to visualize it in meaningful ways  

# TODO:
Implement a random answer generator (with some sensible probabilities)  
Test basic chord diagrams  

# Already done
Basic bar chart of how many times a discipline was mentioned in the form  
Basic histogram of how many people have selected what number of disciplines
