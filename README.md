# hyperViz
Code for the SEMF hyperViz project (link coming soon)  
The initial goal is to parse data collected as a csv via registration forms and to visualize it in meaningful ways  

Currently can create:

- Basic bar chart of how many times a discipline was mentioned in the form  
- Basic histogram of how many people have selected what number of disciplines  
- Basic chord diagram of how many times two disciplines were mentioned in the same response  
- Random sample generator of sets of disciplines, for testing

# TODO:
Visualisation of third degree relations: drawing the hypergraph as a normal graph  
Further testing and deciding on visual aspects  

For SS_2021:

Histograms
 - How many times a discipline was mentioned
 - How many people selected what number of disciplines (in absolute and in %)

[] Chord diagram: how many times two disciplines were mentioned in the same resopns
[] csv data
